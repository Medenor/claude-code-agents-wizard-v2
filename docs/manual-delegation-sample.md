# Manual Delegation Sample Run

## Overview
- **Session**: OpenAI Codex CLI (manual orchestration mode)
- **Todo**: `todo-001 – Create hello world HTML page`
- **Date**: *(recorded manually; update if replayed)*
- **Sandbox**: `workspace-write`, network `restricted`

This log illustrates how the orchestrator, unable to invoke subagents automatically, guided a manual handoff through Manual Delegation Packets. Humans fulfilled the CODER and TESTER roles and relayed evidence back to the orchestrator. Artifacts referenced below (e.g., `hello.html`, screenshots) were produced during the session but are not tracked in this repository.

## 1. Dispatch → CODER

**Manual Delegation Packet**

```
MANUAL DELEGATION PACKET
Act as the coder agent, carefully following .codex/agents/coder.md instructions
TODO ID: todo-001
PHASE: dispatch
TARGET AGENT: CODER
OBJECTIVE: Create hello world HTML page
DETAILS:
- Scope: Add new file `hello.html` at repo root with a minimal valid HTML5 skeleton.
- Acceptance: File renders “Hello, world!” via `<h1>`; includes `<title>Hello, world!</title>`; no extra assets or styling.
- Notes: Generated because automated coder agent is unavailable; keep indentation tidy and use ASCII only.
REQUESTED ARTIFACTS:
- apply_patch-style diff of `hello.html`
- Confirmation the file passes basic validation (e.g., open in browser or `cat` review)
```

**Coder Completion**

```
TODO ID: todo-001
STATUS: success
DIFF:
*** Begin Patch
*** Add File: hello.html
+<!DOCTYPE html>
+<html lang="en">
+<head>
+    <meta charset="utf-8">
+    <title>Hello, world!</title>
+</head>
+<body>
+    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
+</body>
+</html>
*** End Patch
TESTS:
- command: cat hello.html
  exit_code: 0
  output: |
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Hello, world!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
SUMMARY:
- Added hello.html containing a minimal HTML5 skeleton with the required title and <h1> greeting.
FOLLOW-UP:
- none
```

Artifacts: `hello.html`

## 2. Verification → TESTER

**Manual Delegation Packet**

```
MANUAL DELEGATION PACKET
Act as the tester agent, carefully following .codex/agents/tester.md instructions
TODO ID: todo-001
PHASE: verifying
TARGET AGENT: TESTER
OBJECTIVE: Verify hello.html renders correctly
DETAILS:
- Scope: Open `hello.html` in a browser or HTML viewer.
- Acceptance: Confirm `<title>Hello, world!</title>` appears in the document head and `<h1>Hello, world!</h1>` renders without errors; HTML should include `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `<meta charset="utf-8">`.
- Notes: File located at `hello.html`; no scripts or styles expected.
REQUESTED ARTIFACTS:
- Short verification log stating checks performed and outcome
- Optional screenshot of the rendered page if available
```

**Tester Report**

```
TODO ID: todo-001
STATUS: pass
VIEWPORTS:
- size: 1280x720
  screenshot: todo-001-main-1280x720.png
- size: 390x844
  screenshot: todo-001-main-390x844.png
STEPS:
- action: navigate file:///.../hello.html @1280x720; confirmed <!DOCTYPE html>, <meta charset="utf-8">, <title>Hello, world!</title>, and <h1>Hello, world!</h1>; captured screenshot
  result: success
  console_errors: []
- action: navigate file:///.../hello.html @390x844; reconfirmed required head/body elements; captured screenshot
  result: success
  console_errors: []
ISSUES:
- none
RECOMMENDATION:
- ready for release
```

Artifacts: `todo-001-main-1280x720.png`, `todo-001-main-390x844.png`

## 3. Outcome
- Orchestrator recorded coder diff, tester verification, and associated artifacts.
- Todo `todo-001` marked complete with evidence.
- Demonstrates end-to-end manual orchestration compatible with future automated integrations.
